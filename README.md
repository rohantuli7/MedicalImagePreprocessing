# MedicalImagePreprocessing

The main objective of pre-processing is the improvement of image data that suppresses unwilling distortions or enhances some image features important for further processing. Images which are to be passed to the machine learning model in later stages should not contain any noise, biases or missing data as that could lead to the generation of incorrect results. Thus, appropriate image pre-processing methods needs to be applied in order to enhance the image quality which would help us to analyze the images better and to facilitate the extraction of image features which would be passed to the machine learning model along with the pre-processed images for training and testing purposes.
